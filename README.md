## Simple Proxy Server
This Python script sets up a basic proxy server using sockets and threading.
## Update configuration in server.py
* Set proxy host to your server's IP address or 0.0.0.0 for all interfaces.
* By default, these scripts use port 8080 for communication
* Modify remote ip and remote port to point to your Remote target server.
